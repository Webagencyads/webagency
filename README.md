Out of the $2.1 Billion family assets his Private Investment firm Gastauer Family Office is managing, he is ready to allocate €100 Million for further investments in later stage companies planning to finance their growth in the FinTech Industry.

In May 2015, Gastauer had previously invested a first round of €50 Million in early stage Startup companies, offering innovative Technologies for the Financial Industry. One of his investments, global banking platform [WB21](https://www.wb21.com/) had grown from its launch in late December 2015 to more than 2 million users in less than 18 months. The company become a FinTech Unicorn in September 2016, and is currently amongst the fastest growing FinTech companies worldwide.

According to Michael Gastauer, the FinTech Industry has just started to gain momentum. “We haven`t seen any exits or companies growing into massive organizations like an Uber or AirBnB did in other industries. The recent FinTech initiate has a few younger players offering a solid, global business model which has the potential to turn these companies into global players of a twenty billion plus valuation. However, most of these players still need more capital to fuel their fast growth over the next few years. This is why we focus in our second investment round on later stage, growth financing. Given that our approach is to work with a small group of selected companies we invest in, it would also be difficult for us to place 100 million Euros in early stage investments. explained Michael Gastauer, Founder and President of Gastauer Family Office.”
